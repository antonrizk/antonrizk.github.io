about my site

this is a portofilio cite. i wanted to design a simple,
dark, minimal site. using bootstrap tp create a responsive 
layout. the site is a one page scroll site, it is sectioned 
off into 4 parts. home, about, work, and contact. the home section 
is a banner with an intro and a picture of myself. the about me section
is a section where i interduce myself. my work section is designed into cards
i am not yet familiar with java script and would like to make those cards be pop
ups when clicked to tell you more about my work. the contact section you will find my resume icon
where when clicked it would take you to a resume. and you 
will find where i am located. 
i wanted to keep the footer very simple and just add my logo , social media icons and the copyright line.
that is my site. i hope you like it. 

some challenges i faced while making this site would have to be none. it was straight forward. i think the main
challange was learning bootstrap, but i learned that 
pretty fast. another minor challange i faced was trying to figure
out how to make the site my root site in my repo. but with some research 
and trying it out i was able to figure it out.
