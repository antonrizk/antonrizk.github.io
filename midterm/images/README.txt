***** not sure if this will effect my mark. 
but I understand file systems and hierchy. i just messed up 
about how i had things in order and trying to switch things 
broke my eniter code. so im keeping my filing like this which
is a bad format. i am sorry. i dont know how to fix it 
without breaking the entire thing. *********
